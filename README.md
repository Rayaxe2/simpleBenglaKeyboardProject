# simpleBenglaKeyboardProject
A simple Bengali keyboard that I'm making for my tech illiterate mother - who want to comments in Bengali on the Bengali side of YouTube, but is unsure of how to use the Bengali keyboards I've had her try (and so am I). I'm doing this very little knowledge of how to write in the language... XD

Accomplishments:
- Made a dank layout
- Keys output Bengali letters
- Added a Jukto button and library of Jukto words to select on a sugguestion bar when in Jukto mode
- Got it to scale to my mum's 1280 x 800 tablet
- Complied it to run on a winx86 PC

Plans:
- Change layout
  - Make buttons bigger
-- Get rid of redundancies, like the numbers - math is for the weak!
-- Add buttons that mother may want to use
-- Copy windows bangla keyboard layout maybe?
--- Allow users to navigate to more works instead of presenting them all in one place
-- Make UI scale to any common resolution
-- Make the colour changes for modes more intuative 
-- Maybe add a preview of what was written before pressing space in big letters 
-- Make Jukto works bicc'er
- Prevent windows touch keyboard from going on top of it
- Display more relevant and common Jukto sugguestion first 
-- Add side scroll to search
